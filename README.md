| [Lead-to-Candidate trajectory mining - ChEMBL and ClinicalTrials.gov integration] | Integrate ChEMBL and ClinicalTrials.gov to map development programs and analyze optimization “trajectories” across phases. <br><br> Python, SQL/DuckDB/Postgres, RDKit, APIs |
| [RNA-seq Analysis of COVID-19-Related Anosmia] | Single-cell RNA-seq analysis focused on SARS-CoV-2–associated anosmia, including cell-type annotation and differential expression outputs. |
| [Variant calling automation] | End-to-end NGS workflow: dataset retrieval, QC, alignment, and variant calling (VCF) with reproducible scripts and summary outputs. |

## **Supporting projects**

**Data Engineering & Pipelines**

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [GWAS Example PLINK1.9-2.0] | Reproducible GWAS starter workflow with PLINK commands plus wrapper utilities for QC, association runs, and results parsing. |
| [Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium Calculator] | Computes Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium exact test statistics (and p-values) for a single SNP from genotype counts. |
| [ClinicalTrials.gov program linker] | API pipeline that normalizes drug identifiers (names/synonyms) and links compounds to ClinicalTrials.gov studies for program-level analysis. |

**Machine Learning**
| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [UniMol architecture and dataset loader + augmentation] | Implements/organizes UniMol-style 3D molecular inputs with a dataset loader, point-cloud augmentations, and training-ready batching utilities. |
| [SMILES from figure/text extraction pipeline] | Extracts chemical structures from papers by pulling SMILES/IUPAC from text and converting figure-based structures into SMILES for downstream analysis. |

**Data Visualization**

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Distance matrix and phylogeny tree calculation] | Computes sequence distance matrices and builds phylogenetic trees to visualize SARS-CoV-2 variant relationships across time. |
| [PCA Visualization from BAM file] | Runs PCA on aligned sequencing data and generates standard QC visualizations for sample clustering and batch/outlier detection. |
